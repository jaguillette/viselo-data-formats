				<h1>Data Formats</h1>
				<p>Jeremy Guillette<br/>FAS Academic Technology</p>
				<aside class="notes">
					I'm Jeremy Guillette, and before we get into the fun bits of
					visualization, I want to take some time to talk about data formats.
					You won't always have us to prepare nice datasets for you, so it's
					worth spending some time thinking about the ways in which how your
					data is formatted influence what you're able to do with it.
				</aside>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h2>Data as Construct</h2>
				<p><strong>Data is created.</strong> The production of a dataset requires choicess about what and how to collect and how to encode.</p>
				<p><strong>There is no such thing as "raw data"</strong></p>
				<aside class="notes">
					Let's get some basics out of the way. There's no such thing as "raw
					data" coming to us from nature. Every piece of data you find out
					there in the world came into existence because of decisions that were
					made by people about what to record and how to record it.
				</aside>
			</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Organizing a Chili Recipe</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Let's start with a simple example: a chili recipe.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>Unstructured Data</h2>
					<p>For this recipe you will need two pounds of ground beef, a chopped
						half onion, a teaspoon of ground black pepper, half a teaspoon of
						garlic salt, and two and a half cups of tomato sauce.</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						First, we have the recipe as you might find it on a website, as
						unstructured text. The information about what goes into the recipe
						is there, but it's relying on the reader's ability to make sense of
						it.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>An organized list</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>2 pounds ground beef</li>
						<li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
						<li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
						<li>1/2 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
						<li>2 1/2 cups tomato sauce</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now we're getting more organized, with all of the different
						ingredients in the recipe separated out into their own lines. This
						seems like a small step, but in a research project, it can be a big
						deal. By breaking down information into a list of pieces of the
						same sorts of thing, you're deciding what constitiutes an
						individual datum in your dataset.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h2>"Flat" data model</h2>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<th>Amount</th>
							<th>Unit</th>
							<th>Item</th>
							<th>State</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>2</td>
							<td>lbs.</td>
							<td>ground beef</td>
							<td>-</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>0.5</td>
							<td>-</td>
							<td>onion</td>
							<td>chopped</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1</td>
							<td>tsp.</td>
							<td>garlic salt</td>
							<td>-</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>2.5</td>
							<td>cups</td>
							<td>tomato sauce</td>
							<td>-</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<aside class="notes">
						Now we're getting properly structured into a spreadsheet-like data
						format. Spreadsheets are the most common way of structuring data,
						but just because you have a spreadsheet open doesn't mean you're
						structuring your data in a usable way. Here, we have information
						about the ingredients to the recipe broken down into categories.
						We've got the item separated from the amount, unit, and state of
						the ingredient. I set up this structure with making the recipe in
						mind, so I have items to buy at the grocery store, amounts and
						units to tell me how much to buy, and a state to let me know what
						I'll need to do with the items before they can be used. I've
						separated the individual things I'm interested in into rows, and
						decided what properties of those things I care about in this
						mini-dataset by putting them into columns
					</aside>

					<h2>Other Data Models</h2>
					<p>Other models exist, such as hierarchical and relational</p>
					<p>They are more complex, and usually involve coding to produce a visualization</p>
				</section>

					<h2>Wide vs. Tall Data</h2>
					<aside class="notes">
						If you're using someone else's data, it might not come to you in a
						format that's ideal for visualization and analysis. Here's a common
						problem and some ways to deal with it.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Wide data</h3>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<th>Year</th>
							<th>Alabama</th>
							<th>Alaska</th>
							<th>Arizona</th>
							<th>Arkansas</th>
							<th>...</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1824</td>
							<td>49.1</td>
							<td>----</td>
							<td>----</td>
							<td>----</td>
							<td>...</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1828</td>
							<td>54.6</td>
							<td>----</td>
							<td>----</td>
							<td>----</td>
							<td>...</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1832</td>
							<td>31.5</td>
							<td>----</td>
							<td>----</td>
							<td>----</td>
							<td>...</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>46 rows by 56 columns</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						You might find a downloadable summary table of a dataset that looks
						like this one. It looks like a spreadsheet, but what's the actual
						observation represented by each row? A year that occurred, and the
						voter turnouts of various states during that year? In our previous
						example, an instance of an ingredient was what we were interested
						in, and that was related to the purpose of our data structure, to
						record information about the recipe. We had columns related to that
						individual piece of information. Here, the individual pieces of
						data are actually the turnout percentatges for a state in a year,
						but they're not each represented by a row. Let's see what that
						would look like.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Tall data</h3>
					<table>
						<tr>
							<th>Year</th>
							<th>State</th>
							<th>Turnout</th>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1824</td>
							<td>Alabama</td>
							<td>49.1</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1828</td>
							<td>Alabama</td>
							<td>54.6</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>1832</td>
							<td>Alabama</td>
							<td>31.5</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>...</td>
							<td>...</td>
							<td>...</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
					<p>3 columns by 2341 rows</p>
					<aside class="notes">
						This is a different way of structuring the same information, and
						the way the data that one group today will use is actually
						structured. Now each row is an individual observation. We can still
						generate that initial view using a pivot table, but from this
						"taller" view, we can more easily generate visualizations, run
						analyses, subset the data, and enrich each observation with
						additional information.
					</aside>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Going from wide to tall</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Often referred to as "unpivot"</li>
						<li><code>pandas.melt()</code> and/or <code>pandas.wide_to_long()</code></li>
						<li><code>stack()</code> or <code>melt()</code> in R</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">
						Since the method for going from "tall" to "wide" data is usually a
						pivot table, the process of going from "wide" to "tall" data is
						usually referred to as "unpivoting" or "de-pivoting". In
						programming languages, it can also be called "melting" a dataset.
						Python and R have dedicated methods of making this easy, but more
						graphical programs can have a harder time. If you don't use a
						programming language in your data preparation, you can always look
						up "de-pivot" and the name of your preferred tool to find
						approaches that have worked for other folks.
